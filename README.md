# Premature Mortality Project



## Introduction
This project aims to address the pressing issue of premature mortality caused by various risk factors, with a particular emphasis on the often-overlooked factor of air pollution. Premature death, defined as death before the age of 70, is a significant public health concern worldwide. Despite its well-established health risks, air pollution remains pervasive in many parts of the world.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are twofold: firstly, to identify and analyze the primary risk factors associated with premature mortality, with a particular emphasis on air pollution; and secondly, to present these findings in an intuitive and comprehensive dashboard format. The project seeks to offer valuable insights into identifying trends related to both household and outdoor air pollution, and the associated risk factors that contribute to premature mortality. Ultimately, the project aims to provide evidence-based guidance to inform decision-making and policies aimed at addressing premature death due to various risk factors, including air pollution.

## Data Description
The data source for this project is the ["Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) Risk Factors"](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30752-2/fulltext#%20) dataset with the life expectancy dataset. The GBD 2019 dataset is a comprehensive collection of data that provides insights on risk factors linked to premature mortality, segmented by entity, age, and gender. The dataset includes data on a wide range of risk factors, including behavioral, environmental, and metabolic factors. The dataset is large and diverse, requiring careful analysis and processing.

## Technical Details
In this project Independently designed and created sophisticated set of queries to effectively analyze the data. By formulating my own research questions and providing viable solutions using SQL, I have demonstrated my ability to analyze data effectively. To manage the extensive dataset, I thoughtfully designed and structured the database. Furthermore, I employed specific queries and scripts, alongside the Python library  pandas and matplotlib, to extract data, uncover correlations, and construct hypotheses.

## Dashboard
The Dashboard's primary objective is to provide valuable insights on identifying trends related to air pollution and the associated risk factors that contribute to premature mortality. To achieve this objective, the project presents its findings through a comprehensive dashboard that offers a detailed overview of the data. The dashboard is designed to help identify the countries that are most affected by air pollution, as well as those that are making progress in mitigating its effects. The project showcases my presentation and visualization skills by presenting the findings in an intuitive and visually appealing format, demonstrating the ability to effectively communicate complex information.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the primary risk factors associated with premature mortality, with a particular emphasis on air pollution. The project's findings are presented through a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights to stakeholders and policymakers. The project's significance lies in its ability to inform policies and interventions aimed at reducing premature deaths worldwide. The skills and techniques utilized during the project, including data analysis, cleaning, and visualization, are crucial in identifying and addressing public health concerns. The project demonstrates a strong understanding of data analysis and is a valuable contribution to addressing public health concerns related to premature mortality and air pollution.
